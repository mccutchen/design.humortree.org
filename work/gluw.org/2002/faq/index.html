					<strong>If I contribute to the Greater Longview United Way, how will my money be used?</strong>
					<p>All contributions will support the programs and services of the GLUW's member agencies in 2003, either through direct agency support or through GLUW administrative and program support.</p>

					<strong>What is this year's goal? If the Greater Longview United Way reaches its goal, how much of that money will be disbursed directly to member agencies?</strong>
					<p>This year's goal is the highest ever: $1,070,000. Of that amount, $829,300 has been allocated to support agencies; more than $70,000 will be held in reserve in anticipation of uncollectible pledges; and up to $50,000 will support the INFOline of Gregg County, the county's only comprehensive Information and Referral program for health and human services.  The remainder will be used to support the GLUW's campaign and year-round operating expenses.  Administrative costs for the GLUW are less than 13 percent of the annual budget, compared with a national nonprofit organization average of more than 19 percent.</p>

					<strong>How can the United Way keep campaign costs so low?</strong>
					<p>Instead of a large staff, the Greater Longview United Way relies on more than 400 volunteers who dedicate their time and talents to the work of the organization. The GLUW couldn't do it without them - or you!</p>

					<strong>Who decides which agencies are funded, and how much they receive? For instance, I've heard of controversial organizations that are supported by other United Ways. Does our United Way have to give them funding, too?</strong>
					<p>All funding decisions are made right here in Longview, by a committee of local business and community volunteers who work
						very hard throughout the year to learn about our community's most pressing needs and to determine how our community's
						dollars invested through the United Way can best be used.  Every spring, each agency requesting funding provides the Greater Longview United Way an extensive set of documents that illustrate its financial and programmatic activities for the past year, as well as projections for the coming year. The Allocations and Admissions Committee studies the information for all agencies, then convenes for a series of meetings during which all agencies appear to discuss their information and answer questions from the committee. Following this process, the committee members make allocation recommendations based on the total campaign goal. In other words, the Greater Longview United Way doesn't take direction about its funding decisions or member agencies from anyone outside our own community.</p>

					<strong>How many agencies are members of the Greater Longview United Way?</strong>
					<p>In 2003, there will be 20 member agencies of the GLUW. Of these, 19 will receive funding in 2003; one member agency requested no funds for the coming year.</p>

					<strong>What is the connection between the Greater Longview United Way and the United Way of America?</strong>
					<p>The United Way of America has been working in communities throughout American for more than 100 years, assessing and addressing community needs. Our local United Way is fortunate to be able to take advantage of all that knowledge and experience. The GLUW makes an annual investment of less than 1 percent of its revenue to the national organization, and in return it receives the right to use the �helping hands� logo that instantly identifies the United Way; the right to benefit from the United Way of America's national marketing campaign and full access to its Web site; and the ability to take advantage of first-rate training and development opportunities for both staff and volunteers. These trainings and networking opportunities allow the Greater Longview United Way to learn what is effective in other communities and bring those ideas back to Longview to benefit all of us here.</p>

					<strong>I've never been helped by an agency.  Why should I contribute?</strong>
					<p>You may not use any of the services now, but can you be sure that you or your family will never have the occasion to use them? Stop and look at the tremendous range of services provided by United Way agencies. While it is true many of the services provided by United Way-supported programs are for the poor, the hungry, and those in need, there are agencies that provide other necessary community services. The character-building programs of the Scouts and Camp Fire, the education programs of the Parenting Resource Center of East Texas, and the emergency services provided by the American Red Cross are just a few that touch a broad range of our population. There are United Way agencies and programs that you may not have heard of before. What makes United Way so effective is that clients who are served by some lesser-known programs do not fall through the cracks. The fact that United Way agencies are meeting needs of many people in our community helps assure that Longview will be a better place in which to live and work.</p>

					<strong>I don't like one of the agencies in the United Way package. Why should I support the United Way?</strong>
					<p>All United Way agencies provide valuable services to the community. An agency's membership in United Way is based on programs and services it provides and not its popularity.  Trained volunteers visit and evaluate United Way agencies throughout the year, and funds are allocated based on their findings. </p>

				</li>

					<a name="9"></a>
					<strong>Why do some agencies charge fees for their services?</strong>
					<p>United Way agencies operate without discrimination.  Many use a sliding fee scale, where clients pay what they can for the services they receive.  By allowing clients to pay for the services, the agencies are able to stretch their United Way dollars to serve more people.</p>
					<p class="backToTop"><a href="#"><img src="./global/img/upArrow.gif" alt="^" title=""> back to the top</a></p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<a name="10"></a>
					<strong>Why doesn't the Greater Longview United Way include all organizations?</strong>
					<p>First, not all agencies want to be a part of a single, community-wide campaign.  Certain organizations have policies against joining local United Way campaigns.  Also, United Way standards of financial accountability and program services are high.  Some agencies would like to have the United Way seal of approval but don't quite measure up.</p>
					<p class="backToTop"><a href="#"><img src="./global/img/upArrow.gif" alt="^" title=""> back to the top</a></p>

					<strong>I support a favorite charity of my own.  Why give to the United Way, too?</strong>
					<p>We all have our favorite charities, but the problems of the community are much larger than any one agency can handle.  United Way agencies offer a broad mix of programs and services to meet the diverse needs of our total community.  The United Way campaign helps keep individual agency fund-raising costs low.</p>
					<p class="backToTop"><a href="#"><img src="./global/img/upArrow.gif" alt="^" title=""> back to the top</a></p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<a name="12"></a>
					<strong>Does United Way money support church-related activities?</strong>
					<p>United Way funds agencies covering a wide range of services including some that are affiliated with churches. However, all agencies are funded because they meet a critical community need. United Way funds only the service programs, not the religious activities, of these agencies.  Services by all United Way agencies are based on need, regardless of age, sex, race or religion.</p>
					<p class="backToTop"><a href="#"><img src="./global/img/upArrow.gif" alt="^" title=""> back to the top</a></p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<a name="13"></a>
					<strong>Who pays for United Way campaign meetings?</strong>
					<p>United Way event sponsors are civic-minded businesses and organizations that underwrite the costs of United Way campaign events in addition to their generous support of the United Way campaign.</p>
