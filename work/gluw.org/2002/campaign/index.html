			<p><img src="../global/img/campaignLogo.gif" alt="Campaign 2002-2003 Logo: Our Way of Caring" title="" style="margin:10px 20px; float:right;">
			The annual fund-raising campaign fuels the activities of
			both the Greater Longview United Way and its member agencies
			throughout the coming year.  The campaign is about much more
			than dollars; it is about folks caring for each other and about
			each other, and showing that by giving both money and time.
			Similarly, the United Way is about much more than just raising
			money; it is about "uniting the caring power of the community."</p>

			<p>However, the dollars raised during the campaign make it possible for the Greater Longview United Way and its member agencies to achieve their ambitious goal of creating sustained improvement in the quality of life for all who live in the Greater Longview area.</p>

			<p>The needs in Longview are greater than ever, and the generous spirit of its citizens is greater than ever. Because of these two facts, the campaign goal for 2002-2003 is more ambitious than ever:</p>

			<blockquote>$1,070,000</blockquote>

			<p>Who will make that happen? More than 400 volunteers, including
			Campaign Chair Rogers Pope Jr. and Campaign Co-Chairs Susie
			Paul and Ray Stroud Jr.</p>

			<p>And there's a place for YOU! <a href="../contact/">Contact the United Way office</a>
			to volunteer. Together, we can show...</p>
