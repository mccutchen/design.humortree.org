			<h3>Citizen Review Process</h3>

			<p><strong>Community Volunteers decide <a href="#where">where the dollars go</a></strong></p>

			<p>The United Way guarantees that donated funds are used
			wisely to serve people who need help the most.</p>

			<p>The Greater Longview United Way Citizen Review Process is
			embodied in the work of the Allocations and Admissions
			Committee, a group of 40 business and community leaders who
			volunteer their time to learn about our community's most
			pressing needs and to determine how our community's dollars
			invested through the United Way can best be used.</p>

			<p>Every spring, each agency requesting funding provides the
			Greater Longview United Way an extensive set of documents
			that illustrate its financial and programmatic activities
			for the past year, as well as projections for the coming year.
			The agencies participate in site visits on a three-year rotation,
			with seven agencies visited every year by a subcommittee of
			the Allocations and Admissions Committee. The Allocations and
			Admissions Committee studies the information for all agencies,
			then convenes for a series of meetings during which all
			agencies appear to discuss their information and answer
			questions from the committee. Following this process, the
			committee members make allocation recommendations to the GLUW
			Board of Directors.</p>

			<p>The funds allocated during this process are raised during
			the fall campaign and disbursed during the following year.</p>

			<p>The allocations process requires tough choices. No matter
			how successful the fund-raising campaign, there will never be
			enough resources to meet all requests of member agencies. What
			programs are most crucial? Most effective? Which people need
			help the most? COMMUNITY VOLUNTEERS make these difficult
			decisions because they care about our community. The Citizen
			Review Process is the link between community dollars and
			community needs.</p>

			<h3>Where the Dollars Go</h3>

			Greater Longview United Way will receive $829,300 in funding
			during 2003 if the upcoming campaign reaches its goal.</p>
