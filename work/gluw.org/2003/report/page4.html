<h1>2002 Annual Report</h1>

<h2>Campaign Report</h2>
<img class="headshot" src="/core/jpg/rogers.jpg" alt="Campaign Chair, Rogers Pope, Jr." />
<p>The volunteer leadership of the Greater Longview United Way began the 2002-03 campaign with confidence, but also with the knowledge that the campaign would likely prove to be one of the most challenging in the organization's history.  Because of the unstable economic, social and political climate which existed at the time, and because our member agencies were attempting to meet far greater needs with far few financial resources, it was evident that a successful GLUW campaign would require not only a tremendous fundraising effort from our campaign team but also remarkable generosity and personal sacrifice from our supporters.  As the campaign progressed, it was soon clear that both groups were up to the challenge.  </p>
<p>To the delight of everyone involved, the 2002-03 GLUW campaign not only reached its overall goal of $1,070,000, it actually surpassed that goal, and raised more than $1,155,000, the largest amount in our organization's history.  More importantly, because of the hard work of our volunteers and the generosity of our donors, the local nonprofit agencies supported by the Greater Longview United Way became better equipped to meet the health and human service needs of our families, friends and neighbors.</p>
