<h1>2002 Annual Report</h1>

<h2>What Is the United Way?</h2>

<p>The Greater Longview United Way is a broad-based human services support organization that has its roots in the War Chest formed in Longview, Texas, during World War I to conduct community-wide fundraising.  Over the decades it became the Community Chest, then the United Fund, before renaming itself the Greater Longview United Way in 1982. </p>
<p>While assisting local nonprofit agencies to meet a wide variety of health, welfare, and character-building needs, the Greater Longview United Way has distinguished itself as the premier nonprofit fund-raising organization in Gregg County, having raised and distributed over $25 million since the mid-1950s.</p>
<p>The organization adopted a new vision and mission statement in 2002 that acknowledges both its potential and its responsibility to be an agent for positive and lasting change in Longview and Gregg County.</p>

<p>The vision:</p>
<blockquote><p>Uniting the caring power of our community.</p></blockquote>

<p>The mission:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are dedicated to improving the quality of life in our community by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assessing current and emerging needs</li>
<li>Raising funds</li>
<li>Allocating resources</li>
<li>Fostering volunteerism and leadership</li>
<li>Encouraging collaborative efforts.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>


<h2>How It Works</h2>

<p>The Greater Longview United Way has three core activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conducting an annual campaign on behalf of its member agencies</li>
<li>Assessing community needs, evaluating agency performance within the context of those needs, and determining funding allocation</li>
<li>Providing Information and Referral services to the community through the INFOline of Gregg County.</li>
</ul>

<p>While strengthening its traditional supportive relationship with member agencies, the organization is also  recognizing and evaluating opportunities to work collaboratively with other entities to facilitate needed changes in Longview and Gregg County.</p>
<p>It is a volunteer-driven organization, with more than 300 volunteers active during the annual campaign and 40 volunteers driving the agency allocations process.</p>
<p>The staff comprises Executive Director Tish McCutchen, Office Services Manager Leta White, Administrative Assistant Robin Saunders, INFOline Program Manager LaDelle Kay, and INFOline Program Specialist Rosie Metoyer. </p>


<h2>Annual Campaign</h2>
<p>The traditional workplace campaign is the foundation of the Greater Longview United Way's success. Hundreds of businesses and thousands of employees support the United Way through workplace giving, accounting for more than 90 percent of the total. Individual giving at the $1,000+ level receives recognition through the Longview Leadership Society, of which there were more than 80 members in 2002.</p>


<h2>Allocations</h2>
<p>As the steward of the community's dollars, the Greater Longview United Way holds member agencies to high standards of performance and accountability. Each agency that requests funding must provide an audit, a copy of its IRS Form 990, and regular financial statements throughout the year. In addition, members of the Allocations Committee conduct site visits of agencies to learn more about their programs and services. After review of funding applications and a presentation to the full committee by each agency, the Allocations Committee tackles the difficult task of determining the next year's allocations.  </p>
<p>In 2002, twenty local health and human service organizations received $825,000 in funding from the Greater Longview United Way. Those agencies include: </p>
