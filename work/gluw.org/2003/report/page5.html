<h2>Treasurer's Report</h2>
<img class="headshot" src="/core/jpg/dave.jpg" alt="Treasurer, Dave Spurrier" />
<p>During 2002, while our economy faced many challenges, our local Greater Longview United Way again surprised to the upside with another excellent year.  Total gross campaign revenues were $1,079,912.  This campaign represented another record year for the GLUW and displayed yet again the caring nature of the citizens of our great community.  In addition to funding all operating expenses and funding INFOline of Gregg County, our resource and referral service for health and human services, we were able to make available $826,500 (including $1,500 in special recognition) for twenty local agencies. </p>
<p>The financial health of the Greater Longview United Way is sound.  As of 12/31/02, we had a total cash position of $1,174,475.  $834,000 of these funds is held in certificates of deposit and the balance is held in operating accounts.  Of the $834,000, by action of the Board, $500,000 has been designated as a reserve for catastrophes.  </p>
<p>Total fund allocations and functional expenses were $982,049 for 2002, down from $987,006 for 2001 and we had a positive $6,296 net change in assets during 2002.</p>
<p>Once again during 2002, the volunteers and staff working for the Greater Longview United Way along with our caring community of generous supporters have positioned our community for continued success.  </p>
