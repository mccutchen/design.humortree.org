<h2>INFOline Success Stories</h2>

<ul id="successList">
<li>A mother called INFOline in tears asking for a grief support group. Her teenage son  had committed suicide, and she had been trying to deal with the grief.  She stated that Tuesdays were really difficult because it happened on a Tuesday.  The program specialist calmly talked with her until she was again in control of her emotions.  Referrals were then made to local grief-support groups and counseling organizations.</li>
<li class="even">A woman called INFOline requesting assistance in locating eyeglasses for her legally blind boyfriend.  She said that he had broken his eyeglasses and could not function without them and that he could not perform any type of employment until he replaced them.  INFOline staff linked the caller with several organizations to obtain the eyeglasses.</li>
<li>In a matter of a few moments, two callers requested support groups and education groups for persons with colon cancer and diabetes.  Neither had any idea how to find the information.  Within a short time, both were connected to organizations that specialize in those illnesses.</li>
<li class="even">A woman called INFOline stating that she found a suicide note in her teenager's room and needed information immediately.  She was given several local crisis hotline numbers and was appreciative that someone had those numbers available.</li>
<li>On an extremely hot day, a single parent of four children called INFOline for assistance in repairing her broken air conditioner in her home.  Since there were no organizations for referral, INFOline staff contacted a local organization and confirmed that fans were available.  She immediately went to pick up her fan to help cool the home until the air conditioner could be repaired.</li>
<li class="even">A middle-aged woman needed a van equipped with a wheelchair lift to transport her from her home to the Amtrak station.  INFOline referred her to the Longview Transit System.  She called back to say, I am so thankful because I did not know that there was a resource out there to get me to places to travel and shop, etc.  I have always had to rely on family to take me places, and now I can go on my own for the first time in five years.</li>
<li>An employee at Neiman Marcus National Service Center was desperate to get help for her two teenagers, who were stranded in Florida when their automobile quit running. They were far from home and really didn't know where to turn for help.  Her supervisor called the United Way for help.  Through several phone calls to organizations, INFOline had resources available.  </li>
<li class="even">A woman called INFOline needing an after-school tutoring program for her children, but not able to afford the fees.   INFOline contacted a local organization that allowed her to volunteer by helping with duties there, and in exchange her children were able to receive tutoring.</li>
<li>An elderly gentleman who had suffered a stroke was referred to INFOline by the University of Texas Health Center at Tyler for financial assistance with prescriptions.  Several referrals were given to him.  The next day his daughter called INFOline for the phone numbers because she could not read what her father had written the day before.  She expressed gratitude that INFOline staff took the time to repeat the process for them.</li>
<li class="even">Struggling to keep his emotions under control, a man called stating that his young son was extremely ill with pneumonia and needed an expensive antibiotic.  The family had no insurance and had spent several hundred dollars for medical expenses the prior week.  INFOline referred him to a local organization whose caseworker met with him, called a local pharmacy to see what could be done, and assured him that the agency would help.  INFOline received a call the following morning from the caseworker.  She had contacted the family that morning and wanted us to know that the child was much improved.</li>
<li>A woman needed help with information for supervised visitation of the three children in her custody through Child Protective Services.  She is the great-aunt of the children, and the parents were trying to see the children without supervision.  She felt that this was not in the best interests of the children and needed to know whom to call for help.  Following referral to a children's advocacy organization, she received the necessary information.</li>
