<h1>2002 Annual Report</h1>

<h2>President's Report</h2>
<img class="headshot" src="/core/jpg/linda.jpg" alt="2002 President Linda Butter" />
<p>It was my privilege to lead this distinguished organization in 2002, as our community struggled with the aftermath of September 11 and the Enron meltdown. We knew that we would have to redouble our efforts to strengthen the social service safety net supporting Longview and Gregg County. And, thanks to the hard work and dedication of many, we succeeded. </p>
<p>I want to recognize especially the staffs and Boards of the United Way's member agencies. These individuals are on the front lines, tackling tough problems and issues that threaten the well-being of all of us who live and work in Longview. We are proud to partner with them. </p>
<p>Thanks also to my fellow volunteers, as well as to the capable staff of the Greater Longview United Way. It takes all of us to make a difference.</p>
<p>Here are some of our accomplishments during 2002:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Board began implementation of the Strategic Plan, conducting a series of sessions that focused on the four goals: Broadening the Donor Base, Becoming a Year-Round Organization, Fine Tuning the Mission, Diversifying Our Leadership.</li>
<li>The Campaign Steering Committee planned and executed the most successful annual fund-raising campaign in our organization's history. </li>
<li>The Allocations and Admissions Committee worked diligently with member agencies, conducting site visits and opening new lines of communication.</li>
<li>The INFOline of Gregg County helped more than 4,000 Gregg County residents find assistance for a wide range of needs. </li>
</ul>
<p>We ended the year as we began it, with hope for the future and reliance on the strength of the past. </p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to serve as President. I remain committed to the vision of the Greater Longview United Way, and look forward to working with this crucially important organization in the years to come.</p>
