<h2>Executive Director's Report</h2>

<p>The challenges presented by the year 2002 were matched only by the opportunities. As the nation struggled to regain some equilibrium after the devastating events of September 11, 2001, so did Longview and Gregg County. As the concern about Homeland Security and threats to our way of life mounted, so did the needs of our neighbors.  The Greater Longview United Way responded. </p>
<p>We had already begun a significant strategic planning process that recognized the need for this venerable organization, with roots stretching back almost a century, to be more proactive in identifying and responding to needs in our community, and to use its stature as the county's preeminent community-wide fund-raising entity to bring other resources to the table. This strategic planning process continued in 2002, with the Board refining the broad goals and beginning implementation of several. </p>
<p>For the second year, volunteers made a number of site visits to agencies requesting funding, giving the agencies an unprecedented opportunity to show off their programs and facilities, and giving United Way funding decision-makers valuable insight into the agencies' needs and accomplishments. These site visits were instrumental in guiding the Allocations and Admissions Committee's discussions that resulted in an allocation of almost $830,000 to twenty agencies. </p>
<p>The United Way staff welcomed the opportunity to work closely both with the member agencies and with the Allocations volunteers in order to facilitate the allocations process.</p>
<p>2002 was the second year for other things as well, such as the United Way's new location, on South High Street in downtown Longview. The familiar logo painted on the front of the building makes us immediately recognizable to those passing by. </p>
<p>More importantly, it was the second year that the INFOline of Gregg County served the residents of Gregg County by providing information about and referrals to more than 200 health and human service organizations operating in the county. During 2002, its first full year of operation after beginning service in August 2001, the INFOline directly assisted more than 4,500 Longview residents find the help they needed. Through the printed Resource Directory distributed free throughout the county, we indirectly helped thousands more. The INFOline is one way the Greater Longview United Way gives back every day to the residents of Gregg County.</p>
<p>We are more aware than ever of the many stakeholders and partners with which we share a common vision, one in which the life of every person in Longview and Gregg County is full, productive, and healthy. It will take all of us working together to make that vision a reality. We're ready. Will you join us?</p>
