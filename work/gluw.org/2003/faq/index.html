<h2>Their Answers</h2>

<ol class="answersList">
<li>
<a id="q1"></a>
<p class="question">How many agencies are members of the Greater Longview United Way?</p>
<p>In 2004-2005, there will be 19 member agencies of the GLUW.</p>
<p class="backToTop"><a href="faq/#">back to the top</a></p>
</li>

<li>
<a id="q2"></a>
<p class="question">What is this year's campaign goal?</p>
<p>$1,140,000.</p>
<p class="backToTop"><a href="faq/#">back to the top</a></p>
</li>

<li>
<a id="q3"></a>
<p class="question">If the Greater Longview United Way reaches its goal, how much of that money will be disbursed directly to member agencies?</p>
<p>A total of $849,500 has been allocated to support agencies. Of the remainder, more than $74,000 will be held in reserve in anticipation
of uncollectible pledges; approximately $56,521 will support the INFOline of Gregg County; and the remainder will be
used to support the GLUW's campaign and year-round operating expenses.</p>

</li>

<li>
<a id="q4"></a>
<p class="question">How can the United Way keep campaign costs so low?</p>
<p>Instead of a large staff, the Greater Longview United Way relies on more than 400 volunteers who dedicate their time and talents
to the work of the organization. We couldn't do it without them&mdash;or you!</p>
<p class="backToTop"><a href="faq/#">back to the top</a></p>
</li>

<li>
<a id="q5"></a>
<p class="question">I've never been helped by an agency. Why should I contribute?</p>
<p>You may not use any of the services now, but can you be sure that you or your family will never have the occasion to use them?
Stop and look at the tremendous range of services provided by United Way agencies. While it is true that many of the services
provided by United Way-supported programs are for the poor, the hungry, and those in need, there are agencies that provide other
necessary community services. The character-building programs of the Scouts and Camp Fire, the education programs of the Parenting
Resource Center of East Texas, and the emergency services provided by the American Red Cross are just a few that touch
a broad range of our population. There are United Way agencies and programs that you may not have heard of before. What
makes United Way so effective is that clients who are served by some lesser-known programs do not fall through the cracks. The
fact that United Way agencies are meeting needs of many people in our community helps assure that Longview will be a better
place in which to live and work.</p>

</li>


<li>
<a id="q6"></a>
<p class="question">I don't like one of the agencies in the United Way package.</p>
<p>All United Way agencies provide valuable services to the community. An agency's membership in United Way is based on programs
and services it provides and not its popularity. Trained volunteers visit and evaluate United Way agencies throughout the
year, and funds are allocated based on their findings.</p>
<p class="backToTop"><a href="faq/#">back to the top</a></p>
</li>

<li>

<a id="q7"></a>
<p class="question">Why do some agencies charge fees for their services?</p>
<p>United Way agencies operate without discrimination. Many use a sliding fee scale, where clients pay what they can for the services
they receive. By allowing clients to pay for the services, the agencies are able to stretch their United Way dollars to serve
more people.</p>
<p class="backToTop"><a href="faq/#">back to the top</a></p>
</li>

<li>
<a id="q8"></a>

<p class="question">Why doesn't United Way include all organizations?</p>
<p>United Way standards of financial accountability and program services are high. Some agencies would like to have the United
Way seal of approval but don't quite measure up. Also, not all agencies want to be a part of a single, community-wide campaign.
Certain organizations have policies against joining local United Way campaigns.</p>
<p class="backToTop"><a href="faq/#">back to the top</a></p>
</li>

<li>
<a id="q9"></a>
<p class="question">I support a favorite charity of my own. Why give to United Way, too?</p>
<p>We all have our favorite charities, but the problems of the community are much larger than any one agency can handle. United
Way agencies offer a broad mix of programs and services to meet the diverse needs of our total community. The United Way
campaign helps keep individual agency fundraising costs low.</p>
<p class="backToTop"><a href="faq/#">back to the top</a></p>
</li>

<li>
<a id="q10"></a>
<p class="question">Does United Way money support church-related activities?</p>
<p>United Way funds agencies covering a wide range of services including some that are faith based. However, all agencies are
funded because they meet a critical community need. United Way funds only the service programs, not the religious activities, of
these agencies. Services by all United Way agencies are based on need, regardless of age, sex, race, or religion.</p>
<p class="backToTop"><a href="faq/#">back to the top</a></p>
</li>

<li>
<a id="q11"></a>
<p class="question">Who pays for United Way campaign meetings?</p>
<p>United Way event sponsors are civic-minded businesses and organizations that underwrite the costs of United Way campaign
events in addition to their generous support of the United Way campaign.</p>
<p class="backToTop"><a href="faq/#">back to the top</a></p>

</li>

<li>
<a id="q12"></a>
<p class="question">Everything is costing more and more. I just won't be able to give this year.</p>
<p>As the cost of living rises, so does the cost of meeting the community's needs. We all have nickels, dimes, and quarters that we
spend on the things we don't really need. If all the United Way agencies called on you separately over the course of a year, you
probably would find yourself giving $30 or $40 or more. That is why we stress the benefit of making a Care Share pledge with
payroll-deducted payments spread throughout the year.</p>
