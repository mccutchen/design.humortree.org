<h1>About Us</h1>

<p><em>Community.</em></p>

<p>It's what the Greater Longview United Way is all about.</p>

<p>It's what matters.</p>

<p>We're uniting the caring power of our community,
working with many others to create real and lasting change.</p>

<p>The most familiar example of this collaborative spirit is the
annual fund-raising campaign, in which hundreds of volunteers
generous with their time, and thousands of Gregg County businesses
and individuals generous with their pledges, are working hard to empower
the United Way to exceed its ambitious goal.  The 2004-2005 campaign goal
is <strong>$1,140,000</strong>. <a href="campaign/">Click here</a> to
learn more about the 2004-2005 campaign and the men and women who
will make it a success.</p>

<p>How do you give away hundreds of thousands of dollars? It's
not as easy as you might think. The Greater Longview United Way
takes its stewardship very seriously. After all, thousands of
generous donors trust us to make sure that their dollars are
used to make people's lives better. These gifts are truly investments
in Gregg County's future. So we work year-round with the agencies
that receive funding through the United Way.</p>

<p>Building bridges between needs and resources... that's the INFOline
of Gregg County, which provides free and confidential information and
referrals to almost 200 local helping organizations. INFOline has helped
more than 17,000 callers get connected to services they need.</p>
