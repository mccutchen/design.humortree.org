<h1>Allocations</h1>

<h2>Citizen Review Process</h2>

<p><strong>Community Volunteers decide <a href="../allocations/#where">where the dollars go</a></strong></p>

<p>The United Way guarantees that donated funds are used
wisely to serve people who need help the most.</p>

<p>The Greater Longview United Way Citizen Review Process is
embodied in the work of the Allocations and Admissions
Committee, a group of 40 business and community leaders who
volunteer their time to learn about our community's most
pressing needs and to determine how our community's dollars
invested through the United Way can best be used.</p>

<p>Every spring, each agency requesting funding provides the
Greater Longview United Way an extensive set of documents
that illustrate its financial and programmatic activities
for the past year, as well as projections for the coming year.
The agencies participate in site visits on a three-year rotation,
with seven agencies visited every year by a subcommittee of
the Allocations and Admissions Committee. The Allocations and
Admissions Committee studies the information for all agencies,
then convenes for a series of meetings during which all
agencies appear to discuss their information and answer
questions from the committee. Following this process, the
committee members make allocation recommendations to the GLUW
Board of Directors.</p>

<p>The funds allocated during this process are raised during
the fall campaign and disbursed during the following year.</p>

<p>The allocations process requires tough choices. No matter
how successful the fund-raising campaign, there will never be
enough resources to meet all requests of member agencies. What
programs are most crucial? Most effective? Which people need
help the most? COMMUNITY VOLUNTEERS make these difficult
decisions because they care about our community. The Citizen
Review Process is the link between community dollars and
community needs.</p>
