<h1>Campaign 2004-2005</h1>

<p>The Greater Longview United Way works with more than 400 volunteers to
contact thousands of local businesses and individuals during its annual
fundraising campaign. The Pacesetter companies give the campaign a
jump-start during July and August.  This year's Pacesetter Campaign ended
August 27 with a total of $330,226.74.  This represents 29% of the total
ampaign goal.</p>

<p>2004-2005 Pacesetter companies include:</p>

<ul class="pacesetters">
<li>Alcatel</li>
<li>Bemis Custom Products</li>
<li>Borg-Warner</li>
<li>City of Longview</li>
<li>Good Shepherd Medical Center</li>
<li>Holt Cat</li>
<li>KBR</li>
<li>Neiman Marcus Natl. Service Center</li>
<li>Regions Bank</li>
<li>RBC Dain Rauscher</li>
<li>Southside Bank</li>
<li>Spring Hill State Bank</li>
<li>STEMCO</li>
<li>Suzanne Cook &amp; Co.</li>
<li>Tegron</li>
<li>Texas Bank and Trust</li>
<li>United Way Agencies</li>
<li>UPS</li>
</ul>

<p>While the campaign is in high gear during September and October, hundreds
of businesses will give their employees an opportunity to learn about the
needs of our community and the ways they can help by supporting the
programs of the GLUW and its member agencies. Company campaigns often
become opportunities for team-building and morale boosting, as employees
work together to achieve a goal and improve the lives of their neighbors.</p>

<p>The annual fund-raising campaign fuels the activities of
both the Greater Longview United Way and its member agencies
throughout the coming year.  The campaign is about much more
than dollars; it is about folks caring for each other and about
each other, and showing that by giving both money and time.
Similarly, the United Way is about much more than just raising
money; it is about "uniting the caring power of the community."</p>

<p>However, the dollars raised during the campaign make it possible
for the Greater Longview United Way and its member agencies to
achieve their ambitious goal of creating sustained improvement in
the quality of life for all who live in the Greater Longview area.</p>
