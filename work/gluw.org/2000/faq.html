						<strong>Where do my Greater Longview United Way donations go?</strong>
						<br><br>
						<span class="bodytext">
							All donations support the programs and services of our 21 member agencies,
							either through direct agency allocations or through GLUW administrative
							and program support. Administrative costs are less than 11 percent of the
							annual budget, compared with a national United Way average of 14 percent
							and a national nonprofit organization average of 19 percent. In 2002, the
							Greater Longview United Way will disburse $839,000 to its agencies. 
							<br><br>
						</span>
					</li>
					
					<li class="dateline">
						<strong>How are funds allocated to the various agencies that Greater Longview United Way supports?</strong>
						<br><br>
						<span class="bodytext">
							Every spring, each agency provides the the Greater Longview United Way an
							extensive set of documents that illustrate its financial and programmatic
							activities for the past year, as well as projections for the coming year. A
							committee of community volunteers studies the information for all 21
							agencies, then convenes for a series of meetings during which all agencies
							appear to discuss their information and answer questions from the committee.
							Following this process, the commmittee members make tentative allocations to
							the agencies based on the total campaign goal. The allocations are finalized
							following the conclusion of the fall fund-raising campaign.
							<br><br>
						</span>
					</li>
					
					<li class="dateline">
						<strong>Can a donor specify to which agency his/her donation is allocated?</strong>
						<br><br>
						<span class="bodytext">
							Yes. On each pledge card is a list of GLUW member agencies, followed by a line
							upon which a donor can write the name of an agency to which he or she would like
							to designate a donation. All designations to GLUW member agencies are honored. 
							<br><br>
						</span>
					</li>
					
					<li class="dateline">
						<strong>Did any of the locally raised funds go to support the New York City and Washington, D.C., disasters?</strong>
						<br><br>
						<span class="bodytext">
							The Red Cross and the Salvation Army, which have been heavily involved in the
							recovery process in New York City and Washington, D.C., have been member agencies
							for many years. Therefore, our local funds have been supporting their activities
							all along. Just as other communities' donations to the Red Cross would end up in
							Longview if we suffered a disaster, some of the Red Cross funds raised in Longview
							have aided other communities in times of need. 
							<br><br>
							However, we feel that it is very important to emphasize that our local needs not
							only are still here but are likely to increase. The Red Cross is still providing
							assistance to local fire victims; the Salvation Army still provides hot meals and
							shelter every day, right here in Longview. Our other member agencies also are
							responding daily to our neighbors' needs for food and shelter, child care, physical
							and emotional rehabilitation, advocacy, substance abuse prevention, and protection
							from domestic abuse, as well as many other services. 
							<br><br>
							The local safety net of human service agencies must remain intact so that those,
							and other, needs can be met. We believe that the Greater Longview United Way can
							help best by strengthening our local agencies.
