<p><img src="images/photos/alice-portrait-large.jpg" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10">Welcome to the Brookhaven College website. Regardless of your reason for visiting this electronic environment&mdash;personal college explorations, research about Brookhaven College programs and costs, information about our location and class schedules, even information about our faculty&mdash;we are glad you are investigating Brookhaven College.</p>
<p>Brookhaven College is a comprehensive community college offering good, solid transfer educational programs; vocational-technical programs in areas as broad as automotive technology, visual communications, and fashion merchandising; many levels of English as a second language instruction; and a varied array of non-credit options to teach you computer skills, prepare you for various national licensure exams, and help you prepare for a new career.</p>
<p>We offer a wide array of arts courses and performances through an exceptionally strong fine arts program in music, art, dance and theater, and a 600 seat performance hall. We also have a physical education program and gymnasium and a Student Services Center where student services are located in a "one-stop" environment.</p>
<p>Brookhaven College's Ellison Miles Geotechnology Institute is one of only three such facilities in the nation offering continuing education to oil and gas professionals.   A newly renovated business studies computer center houses more than 200 student computers.  A recent expansion to fine arts facilities, include a new 2,400 square-foot gallery, a renovated ceramics/kiln yard and a Macintosh computer lab.</p>
<p>Our credit and non-credit courses are available in many modes, from a traditional classroom setting with classes that meet morning, afternoon, evenings, and weekends, to video courses supported through faculty-led orientations sessions and electronic mail communications to courses that are presented completely through web-based instruction. Our programs are strong academically and recognized by senior institutions for transfer of credits. The 48-hour Core Curriculum is guaranteed to transfer as a block to any public college or university in Texas, so if your plans include transferring to a Texas public university, it is to your distinct advantage to complete the core at Brookhaven College.</p>
<p>Just having celebrated our 23rd year, Brookhaven College is the newest of the Dallas County Community College District colleges. We enrolled 10,000 credit students this fall and serve an additional 10,000 non-credit students. We are easy to find from both Interstate 635 and Interstate 35, nestled in the heart of Farmers Branch, a thriving suburb of the Dallas northern corridor. Visit us anytime.</p>
