					A third generation carpenter with a gift for design and balance, a love for wood, and a willingness to work hard, made furniture for family and friends. The furniture was so well-liked, it was suggested that he consider making furniture to sell. Being a man of adventure, he took the suggestion and in January of 1986 Oak Reflections was born. Many of the current and original designs had their origins in the family carport, and the garage soon became so filled with tools and products it became necessary to expand once again and move to our "wood shop". Over the years, we have been blessed with great success, all the while striving to do things the old-fashioned way to provide quality products at reasonable prices.<br><br>
										
					What goes into the making of Oak Reflections furniture? The resident artist, who is also our founder, designs our furniture without even an initial drawing as a guide. He picks up a piece of wood, and with only an idea in mind begins to "sculpt" it into form, always thinking, looking, and trying new designs. We offer many tried-and-true designs, as well as many new pieces.<br><br>
									
					For more that ten years we have been buying oak lumber from a mill in Arkansas, where the oak is hand-selected for color and clarity, and then dried and planed especially for us. We regularly make trips to Arkansas to pick up the wood, and as a result have been able to keep costs down and yet maintain our quality standards.<br><br>
					
					From the very beginning, our furniture has been hand made with pride in our workmanship, and we have never used anything but solid oak, or possible oak plywood, when construction or a certain design element requires it.<br><br>
					
					Oak Reflections' perfected finish has come about as a result of trial and error, and it has not been an easy process. We have experimented with several manufacturers, and tried just about every product on the market. We now mix our own stains, and can consistently maintain color, clarity and finish. Many customers collect our furniture, and we want them to add to their collections year after year, with confidence that their furniture looks as though it was all purchased at the same time. The finish on Oak Reflections furniture is quite durable, and no special care is necessary to maintain its original luster.<br><br>
