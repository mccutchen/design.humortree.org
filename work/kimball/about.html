<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>Georgia W. Kimball Elementary School was established in 1985 in Mesquite, Texas
and is the home to approximately 350 students. Student achievement at Kimball
Elementary ranks high among district and state standards. Kimball Elementary is
extremely proud of its diversity and strives to serve all children and their
families to the maximum extent possible. The dedicated teaching staff continually
provides academic opportunities that challenge and develop students, ultimately
preparing them for a successful future. As reflected in the school motto, we are
"In a League of Our Own!"</p>

<h2>Who is Georgia W. Kimball?</h2>
<p>Georgia W. Kimball has been active in local and national education for many years.
She served for 15 years as a Mesquite ISD school board trustee, including tenure as
President.  She was active in the PTA and served both at the Texas and national levels.

<h2>A word from the principal</h2>
<p>As we begin the second semester, I would like to thank you for your continued support of our efforts to ensure that
all Kimball children receive the best that education has to offer. We would NOT be successful without the partnership
that we share with all of you.</p>
<p>The second semester is full of academic challenges for the students. State testing seems to dominate the calendar and
preparation for the tests is ongoing. Please continue to check the website as well as the school marquee for testing
information. Testing sometimes varies according to grade level and program/subject. Often times, our children participate
in state required field tests where schedules are not advertised.</p>
<p>I consider it a privilege to have the opportunity to work with you and your child/children. Please feel free
to <a href="mailto:kcummings@mesquiteisd.org">contact me</a> or call me if you have questions or concerns regarding the
spring testing requirements.</p>
