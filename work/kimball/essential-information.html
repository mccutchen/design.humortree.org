<h2>Catch Corner</h2>
<p>This school year, the CATCH program continues at Kimball and across the MISD.  CATCH stands for Coordinated Approach to Child Health.  The coordinated effort takes place between the classroom teachers, food service program, and families at home.  </p>
<p>Our teachers incorporate healthy lifestyle elements into the curriculum, while Coach Holley utilized CATCH activities at all grade levels.  Our food service department provides nutritious meals and emphasizes healthy eating through various activities.  </p>
<p>We'll utilize this site throughout the year to offer helpful information that may benefit you at home.  We'll also host two Family Fitness events at the school and encourage you to take part.  The first event will take place during our annual Reindeer Run and the other will be scheduled sometime in the spring.</p>
<p>Thank you for supporting us and joining in our efforts to promote a healthy lifestyle among Kimball students.</p>


<p><span class="inset"><img src="img/aha-logo.gif" alt="" /></span>February is "Heart Health" month, as noted by the American Heart Association.  In order to support the efforts of the American
Heart Association, Kimball students will participate in "Jump Rope for Heart."  The event is intended to raise not only money for
the Heart Association, but also awareness of the importance of heart health.  Coach Holley has coordinated this program in all 
P.E. classes and we encourage you to take part by donating to the American Heart Association.  We also hope this month's emphasis
on heart health will foster healthy lifestyle choices for our Kimball Students.</p>

<p>Following is a list of recommended healthy eating patterns suggested by the American Heart Association:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Eat foods low in saturated fat, cholesterol and total fat.</li>
	<li>Choose a variety of foods to get enough carbohydrates, protein, and other nutrients.</li>
	<li>Eat only enough calories to maintain a healthy weight for your height and build.</li>
</ul>

<div id="parking-lot-rules">
<h2>Parking Lot Rules</h2>
<p>Please remember to adhere to the parking lot guidelines when dropping off and
picking up your children.  All guidelines are in place to protect the children.</p>
<p class="with-summary">Specifically, <strong>the right lane is for dropping off
<em>only.</em></strong>  It is helpful if all cars stop near the flagpole as this
allows more people to drop off at the same time.  Please wait patiently in line
for the cars ahead of you to drop their children off.  There is an increased
danger for the children when cars pass each other in an effort to hurry through
the line.</p>
<p><strong>The left lane is reserved for through traffic and should <em>never</em> be used for dropping students off</strong>.
Children should never be allowed to cross the parking lot without adult supervision.  Thank you for helping us ensure the safely of all Kimball
students.</p>
