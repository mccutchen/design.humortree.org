# VoteDraper.com

The original VoteDraper.com web site was built using a home-grown PHP CMS. This
directory contains the original PHP code alongside a plain HTML mirror of the
site, suitable for static hosting.

The CMS code is preserved in the [./update](./update) directory.

The mirror was generated by serving the original site using docker:

```
docker run --rm -p 8080:80 -v $(pwd):/var/www/html php:7-apache
```

and using `wget` to download every page:

```
wget --mirror --page-requisites --html-extension --convert-links http://localhost:8080/
```
