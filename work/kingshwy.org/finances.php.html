<h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>The Kings Highway Conservation District Neighborhood Association was organized in 1998, and was later incorporated under the laws of Texas in 2003.  KHCD
    is registered as a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization with the Texas Comptroller's Office and the Internal Revenue Service, so donations to our cause are
    tax-deductible to the extent provided by law.  Our objectives include aiding the City of Dallas in effectively administering the conservation district ordinance for our
    neighborhood; fostering the preservation and restoration of our historical neighborhood through physical improvements as well as community-building activities; and
    raising awareness of the Kings Highway neighborhood and North Oak Cliff among Dallas residents and city agencies.</p>

<h3>Use of Funds</h3>
    <p>All KHCD expenditures are authorized by a majority of the board, and our goal is to achieve the most efficient use of our limited resources.  In 2004-2005, we
    successfully raised over $2,000 for the design and installation of street sign toppers featuring our district name and logo.  In 2005, work began on the <a href="about/stonepark.php.html">Stone Park
    Rehabilitation Project</a>, which is our main funding goal at this time.  Other current uses for funds include the redesign of our website, printing our quarterly
    newsletter, and small administrative expenses.</p>

<h3>Funding Sources</h3>
    <p>As a small not-for-profit organization, KHCD relies on a variety of sources to fund its day-to-day operations and larger improvement projects. <a href="http://www.careclicks.com">CareClicks.com</a> is our number one potential source for funding, with a portion of all online purchases
	made from the site going directly to KHCD.</p>

<h4>Fundraising Events</h4>

<p>Each winter, KHCD hosts a silent auction and potluck dinner.  We
gather a variety of wonderful items and services donated by our
residents and area businesses, then all friends and neighbors are
invited to share food and drinks while they bid on the prizes.  Our
2006 auction was a huge success, raising over $2,500 thanks to
overwhelming support from the businesses of Davis Street and the Bishop
Arts District.</p>

<p>In the springtime, we organize a neighborhood garage sale.  Our
April 2006 sale featured many items of furniture, a complete set of
kitchen cabinetry, a vintage sewing machine, and a working pay phone,
to mention only a few items.  Despite uncooperative weather, our
half-day sale raised nearly $1,000.</p>

<p>Finally, in October we hold a pancake brunch coinciding with the
Old Oak Cliff Conservation League's Home Tour.  This is an
excellent social event attended by our own residents as well as those
visiting the homes of our neighborhood featured on the tour.  We look
forward to the home selection process and another successful brunch
this fall.</p>

<h4>Newsletter Advertising</h4>

<p>The Kings Highway Chronicle is published and circulated to our 750+
residents four times a year, sharing neighborhood news and providing
notice for upcoming events.  Local businesses purchase advertising
space in the Chronicle, which helps to offset our printing costs.  For
information on advertising in our newsletter, please <a href="mailto:newsletter@kingshwy.org">contact our Newsletter Editor</a>.</p>

<h4>Grants</h4>

<p>KHCD applies for grants from various public and private
organizations.  In 2005, we were the proud recipient of a $1,500 grant
from the Old Oak Cliff Conservation League.  This award was used to
help fund the design phase of our Stone Park project.  In 2006, we received another
$2,000 OOCCL grant to begin the concrete sidewalks of Stone Park.  We are thankful for their
continued support of neighborhoods like ours.  If you have experience
in the grant application process, or if you know of an organization
offering grants applicable to our mission, we would appreciate your
insight.  Please <a href="mailto:treasurer@kingshwy.org">contact our Treasurer</a>.</p>

<h4>Tom Thumb Good Neighbor Program</h4>

<p>KHCD is enrolled in Tom Thumb's <a href="http://www.tomthumb.com/goodneighbor.asp">Good Neighbor Program</a>.
Through this program, individuals may complete a simple form to add
KHCD's identification number to their existing Reward Card account.
Tom Thumb will then donate 1% of every purchase associated with that
card back to KHCD, excluding certain purchases such as alcohol and
prescription medicine.  This program costs nothing to you; you still
pay the same discounted price for your purchases.</p>

<p>While purchases at any Tom Thumb or Simon David location count
toward this program, you will find the <a href="http://maps.yahoo.com/maps_result?addr=315+S.+Hampton+St.&amp;csz=75208&amp;country=us&amp;new=1&amp;name=&amp;qty=">nearest store</a> on the west side of Hampton, just south of
Jefferson.  To register your Reward Card in the program, simply print
the following form, enter your Reward Card number, and turn the form
in at the customer service desk of any Tom Thumb.  The same form can
be used to link your Reward Card to an airline frequent flyer account,
but this information isn't required for simply adding Kings Highway's
good neighbor number (11025).  The application, as a PDF, can be obtained
from the Good Neighbor <a href="http://www.tomthumb.com/GN_DALLAS.pdf">website.</a></p>

<h4>Individual Donations</h4>

<p>Last, but certainly not least, KHCD depends on individual
donations.  We do not actively solicit donations or maintain a
voluntary neighborhood dues system at this time, but we are always
deeply grateful for your contributions.  We are exploring options for
an online payment feature, but checks can be made payable and mailed
to:</p>

<p class="address">Kings Highway Conservation District<br />
P.O. Box 4566<br />
Dallas, Texas  75208</p>

<p>A receipt acknowledging your tax-deductible contribution will be
mailed to you if you provide your return address.</p>

<p>For questions on any finance-related matters, please feel free to <a href="mailto:treasurer@kingshwy.org">contact our
Treasurer</a>.</p>
