    <p>The eclectic style homes of Kings Highway consist of multi-family homes, apartments, and buildings that once housed
    commercial properties.  Many of the apartments along Kings Highway housed families awaiting the construction
    of their new homes in the Winnetka Heights neighborhood.  <a href="http://www.apartments.com/thehomesofkingsway">The Homes of Kings Way</a>,
    led by architect and Kings Highway resident, Rick Garza, seek to preserve the integrity of the apartment buildings and provide another housing
    alternative in the nieghborhood.</p>
