<h4>Organization Income</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.careclicks.com/">CareClicks.com&#8482;</a> is affiliated with over 1,000 quality online merchants, many of which are household names where you already shop. In return for our directing consumers to a merchant's website, they compensate <a href="http://www.careclicks.com/">CareClicks.com&#8482;</a> with a portion of each transaction, called an affiliate commission. Based on our unique "profit sharing" formula, we in turn forward 100% of standard base commissions and standard volume based performance bonuses (where applicable), less our administrative expenses and fees. The commission percentage range you see next to the merchant's name in our directory is exactly what your organization receives, with all expenses already reflected. Amounts vary from merchant to merchant, ranging anywhere from 1.0% for a $1,000 computer, to 30% for a $20.00 magazine subscription. Please refer to the Group Income section to the right of each merchant for exact compensation levels.</p>
<p>On average, the purchases you make will generate between 5.00-6.00% net revenue for your organization. In order to maximize earnings for our clients, we also pool all nonprofit partner sales activity to qualify for higher compensation levels, when applicable. This means more money raised for your group, even though alone, you would not have qualified. As you can see, <a href="http://www.careclicks.com/">CareClicks.com&#8482;</a> truly cares about its partnerships.</p>
