# kingshwy.org

The original kingswhy.org web site was built using simple PHP includes. This
directory contains the original PHP code alongside a plain HTML mirror of the
site, suitable for static hosting.

The mirror was generated by serving the original site using docker:

```
docker run --rm -p 8080:80 -v $(pwd):/var/www/html php:7-apache
```

and using `wget` to download every page:

```
wget --mirror --page-requisites --html-extension --convert-links http://localhost:8080/
```

All PDF and MS Word documents (old meeting notes, flyers, etc) were deleted.
