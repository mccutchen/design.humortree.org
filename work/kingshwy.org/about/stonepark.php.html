    <h4>What&#8217;s in a Name</h4>

    <p><i>From an interview with Mrs Tommye Stone, widow
    of W.W. Stone, and Jeanette and Jim McCally, business associates and
    friends.  Interviews were taken on October 15, 1993 by Howard Atkinson,
    KHCD president and Garyesue Tullos, KHCD Vice President and Historian.</i></p>

    <p>Stone Park was the name chosen for the small triangle on Green at
    Edgefield around 1994.  A survey and vote was taken at that time,
    asking for suggestions on a name for the triangle, under a program
    known as &#8220;Adopt a Park.&#8221;  Of the 36 responses, 23 votes were
    cast for the &#8220;Stone Park&#8221; name.  Why did so much of the
    neighborhood choose to name the park &#8220;Stone Park?&#8221; </p>

    <p>For that answer, let us look at the man behind the name.</p>

    <p>William Wood Stone, known as &#8220;Stoney,&#8221; was born in
    Shreveport, Louisiana on September 9, 1912.  Stoney met his future wife,
    Tommye Sawyer of Brownwood, Texas, while attending high school in
    Shreveport; however, they did not begin dating until he was 24.  They
    were married two years later in 1941, when he was employed by
    C. Wallace, building the Navy shell loading plant in McAllister, Oklahoma.
    The marriage lasted 34 years.</p>

    <p>During World War II, Stoney volunteered to serve in the Marine
    Corps in the 4th Marine Division.  Two promotions later, he was a
    Master Sergeant.</p>

    <p>For 34 years, Mr. Stone worked for C. Wallace Plumbing of Dallas.
    He worked government contracts both before and after the war.  His
    duties for this large mechanical contractor included purchasing all
    materials and equipment and scheduling them for the jobs.
    C. Wallace&#8217;s projects included many Dallas landmarks such as the
    Dallas Morning News Building downtown.</p>

    <p>Tommye and W.W. Stone moved into their upper apartment at Tommye&#8217;s
    present address at 1324 Kings Highway when Stoney was discharged from the
    Marines around 1947.  The red brick apartment house was then owned by
    Mrs. R.F. Ford.  Soon, Stoney became the &#8220;fix it&#8221; man for every
    one who needed help with something.  As surrounding areas developed,
    and Kings Hwy became more of a throughway, he petitioned the city for
    a stop light at the corner of Edgefield and Kings Hwy.  This was not
    passed, so he started a petition for a four-way stop sign.  Although
    it was not put in under his petition, the city eventually did put one
    in where it was needed.</p>

    <p>In 1957 when the infamous tornado swept through Dallas,
    skipping around Oak Cliff, the Stones were in their car under the
    Commerce Street viaduct watching it.  Several houses on Kings Highway
    were moved or destroyed.  The Stone&#8217;s were among several neighbors
    who took in the newly homeless.</p>

    <p>During the time the Stones were renting the apartment, Mrs. Ford
    was diagnosed with cancer.  The Stones offered to buy the building,
    and when they did, W.W. let Mrs. Ford live in her apartment rent free
    for as long as she wished.  She passed away a year later.</p>

    <p>Stoney was a primary advocate of neighborhood children both
    financially and with his time.  Stories abound of his taking groups of
    children to see Dallas Cowboys games on Sundays, working at Rosemont
    Elementary School carnivals, and of helping and clothing less
    privileged children of the neighborhood.</p>

    <p>Once, while playing golf at Stevens Park, he made a 325-yard hole
    in one near the dogleg at Colorado Blvd.  The Edgefield-Green Park,
    just a block from his home, was unofficially adopted by Stone as he
    frequently mowed it and spent time there on evening walks.</p>

    <p>Stoney died on September 5, 1975, just 4 days before his 63rd birthday.
    He was a highly respected man in the neighborhood who fought to keep
    the area on a forward track. He was the neighborhood
    association during a time when one did not formally exist.  Naming the
    park Stone Park was not only a fitting memorial to this community
    leader, but also a true tie to the past.</p>

    <h4>What We&#8217;re Doing</h4>

        <p>To enhance our neighborhood, the Kings Hwy Conservation
        District is planning to re-landscape and build a covered
        arboretum in a small triangular Park in the Kings Hwy
        Conservation District at the corner of Edgefield Avenue and
        Green Street. The property was home to one of the first 7-11
        corner stores in Dallas.  This park will be used by
        neighborhood residents and for neighborhood functions.  The
        project will be done in phases.  Phase I, already completed,
        was to have a professional landscape architect devise a plan,
        with conservation and low maintenance a priority.  Phase II
        will create decomposed granite walkways and concrete walks and
        ramps.  It will also include the break up and removal of part
        of an old concrete slab that still remains on the lot. Phase
        III will include the implementation of the finalized plan to
        be submitted by the landscape architect, including all
        landscaping and the arboretum. </p>

        <p>Carol Feldman, of Feldman Design Studios of Dallas, has
        been contracted for the rehabilitation. Ms. Feldman is a
        professional landscape architect and Oak Cliff resident who
        specializes in native Texas plants and is an expert in
        rainwater capture. Features to be included in Stone Park are a
        covered pavilion and a welcoming garden area that can be
        enjoyed by neighborhood residents.  The overall design should
        use sustainable principles like rainwater collection and low
        water use native plantings.  The pavilion will be integrated
        with a rainwater capture system that will irrigate a native
        plant landscape, thereby reducing water usage, resulting in a
        utility savings to the taxpayers and the Dallas Parks
        Department. KHCD has already obtained three of the barrels
        designed for capturing rainwater. The overall design would
        also reflect the historical significance of the triangle park
        area.  </p>

        <p>The projected cost of the rehabilitation of Stone Park is
        close to $65,000.  Included in this cost is the landscape and
        hardscape design ($4,000), landscaping and hardscaping
        ($18,000), and a prefabricated, craftsman-style pavilion
        ($40,000).  Finally new sidewalks and walkways will be added
        to the park.  Benches and bricks in the pavilion wall will be
        available for sponsorship.  The Kings Highway Conservation
        District has already received two grants for the project from
        the Old Oak Cliff Conservation league, totaling $3,500, for
        Phases I and II of the project.  Along with the grants, close
        to $5,000 has already been raised by the neighborhood and
        dedicated to this project.  The funds came from two
        neighborhood yard sales and a silent auction.</p>

        <p>The park will be open for use by the residents of the
        neighborhood and will create a central gathering place to
        strengthen our sense of community.  It also will enhance the
        neighborhood beauty and appeal, increase the value, and help
        reduce crime (Dallas Police Chief Kunckle recently recommended
        planting flowers as a means of reducing crime.)</p>

        <p>KHCD has a standing committee responsible for final design
        and implementation approval.  All neighbors are invited to
        participate.  Please <a href="mailto:oldoakcliff@kingshwy.org">contact Jennifer Zubiate</a>
        for more information or to volunteer.</p>
