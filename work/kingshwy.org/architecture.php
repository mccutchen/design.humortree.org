<p>The Kings Highway neighborhood is an asset to the City of Dallas
because of its collection of important architectural styles.  The
homes in the Kings Highway neighborhood were built primarily in the
1910s and 1920s.  <a href="/architecture/craftsman.php">Craftsman</a>, <a href="/architecture/prairie.php">Prairie</a>,
<a href="/architecture/tudor.php">Tudor</a>, and <a href="/architecture/eclectic.php">Eclectic</a>
styles common to this era are widely represented throughout.  During
this period, the apartments along the southeastern portion of Kings
Highway provided temporary housing for those awaiting the construction
of their homes in the adjoining neighborhood of Winnetka Heights.</p>

<p>Bungalows reflect the whole range of architectural movement of
their day, from Craftsman to Prairie to Tudor style.  The information
below lists the architectural characteristics of the Bungalow home
style that you will see throughout the area.</p>
