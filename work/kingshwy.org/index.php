        <p><span class="intro">The Kings Highway Conservation District</span>, situated in
        the heart of Oak Cliff, was the first conservation district created in Dallas. There
        has been massive renovation and restoration of older buildings, from single family homes to multi family residences.
        The neighbors of Kings Highway host weekly, monthly, and annual <a href="/events.php">events</a>, and spend much of their
        time walking their dogs, sitting on porches, or working in their yards.  Pride in the diversity of
        the neighborhood and respect for the preservation of the buildings are what attract new neighbors, and keep
        so many here for years, even decades. Kings Highway is currently working on plans to renovate and landscape
        <a href="/about/stonepark.php">Stone Park</a>, the small triangular park at the corner of Edgefield and Green Streets.</p>
