	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Humor Tree Design Coalition (HTDC)</b> is a group of 
	energetic young men who want nothing more than to make the world a little bit nicer
	to look at.
	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coalition is a diverse group, whose members are skilled
	in numerous subjects:  art, music, computer science, and engineering.  They enjoy
	life, and are the sort of people who find beauty in the simplest of things.
