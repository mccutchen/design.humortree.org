             Humor Tree is our playground. It is where we learn our new tricks.
         It is an ongoing project, and probably won't end until we know all
         that there is to know about the internet. Be warned: the site is
         "cutting edge" and "experimental," so you'll need a 4.0+ browser to
         look at it.<br>

             Oak Reflections is a hand-made furniture company based in
         Longview, Texas. We were hired to completely re-make their site. The
         previous version was a mangled mess produced with Microsoft Word. It
         was terrible.<br>

             The Greater Longview United Way's was created with one thing in
         mind: outreach. We made the site very simple, to make sure that anyone
         with an internet connection could look at it, and benefit from it.<br>
