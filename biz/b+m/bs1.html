W&nbsp;E&nbsp;&nbsp;H&nbsp;E&nbsp;R&nbsp;E at B+M DESIGN COALITION hate anti-aliased text.  We are a lone pillar in the
fight against anti-aliasing.  You will only see aliased text in our designs for ourselves.  There are, of course, going to be some
clients who think that aliased text is ugly, or looks out-dated.  We are rational people, and understand that compromise is a 
necessary evil, so you may actually find anti-aliased text on some of our clients' materials.
