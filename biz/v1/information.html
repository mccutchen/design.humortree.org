			THE HUMOR TREE DESIGN COALITION is energetic and creative.  It has fresh ideas about what "design" is.
			The HUMOR TREE DESIGN COALITION knows that design is not drop-shadows and animated GIFs on web-sites.
			Design, at its most absolutely simple, is about conveying information.  The HUMOR TREE DESIGN COALITION
			is an information architect.

			It knows that communication is the most important thing about design.
			It also knows more about the ever-changing technology that powers web design than all of the competition.
			The HUMOR TREE DESIGN COALITION can say this because it is young, with its average age weighing in
			somewhere around 22 years old.  It learns faster than the competition, and it is bolder, willing to take
			more risks.

			It believes that design is about exploration and discovery.  About interaction.  It hopes that you
			experienced a slight shock and surprise when you discovered that you can change the color of almost
			everything on this site.  That is why the HUMOR TREE DESIGN COALITION strives to keep abreast of the
			newest technologies powering the internet.  It wants to make "web experiences" instead of "web sites."
