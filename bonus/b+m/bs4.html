S&nbsp;I&nbsp;M&nbsp;P&nbsp;L&nbsp;I&nbsp;C&nbsp;I&nbsp;T&nbsp;Y is like our loving step-father.  Although it would be fun to 
write dHTML heavy web-sites, we try to stay away from flamboyancy.  We use as little scripting as possible to get the job done.  
The pages that you are looking at now have a small amount of javascript in them, but very little, and the javascript just serves
to help us keep the site simple by offering a little variation at almost no cost.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="bs5.html" target="_self">&raquo;</a>
