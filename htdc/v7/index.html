	<h3>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;About Us</h3>
	<div class="container">
	We are three college students who enjoy making web sites.
	We feel energized by the unique challenges presented by
	every site we get the chance to build.  We love the process.
	<br /><br />
	We want to do things differently.  We want to make web sites
	like no one else makes.  We want to do things that have
	never been done before.
	<br /><br />
	We never stop exploring possibilities and learning new
	things.
	<br /><br /><br />

	<h3>II.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Way We Work</h3>
	<div class="container">
	<ol>
		<li>
			Initial meeting.  At this point we do our best to
			get to know you and your business, so that we can try
			to help you figure out exactly where a web site would
			help you out.  If we feel that you wouldn't gain anything
			from a web presence, we will let you know.<br /><br />
		</li>
		<li>
			Based on the initial meeting, we create a timeline
			that maps out the stages of development that are
			required to produce your web site.  We estimate how
			long we expect each stage to take, and how much
			we charge for each stage.  We then return this timeline
			to you, for you to review.<br /><br />
		</li>
		<li>
			Once we agree on a timeline, we present you with a
			consulting agreement to sign.  We offer two methods
			of payment at the moment, and at this point you will
			pick which method you would prefer to use to pay us.
			Once the initial payment has been made, we start the
			development of your site.<br /><br />
		</li>
		<li>
			Once the development has started, we follow the timeline.  Generally,
			we present you with an initial design that we feel
			meets the goals you've set for your site.  You are
			welcome to make suggestions for improvements, or to
			request a new design.  Once a design is chosen, we
			begin to code the site.  We will give you a web
			address where you can check our progress on the site,
			and make sure that you are comfortable with it.  Once
			the site is completely finished and thoroughly tested,
			we present it to you on your choice of mediums: floppy
			disk, CD, or Zip disk.  Or, we can upload it straight
			to your server.<br /><br />
		</li>
		<li>
			In the months that follow, we check with you to make
			sure that everything is running smoothly, and to see
			if there are any changes that need to be made.  We
			want you to be completely satisfied.
		</li>

	<h3>III.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Skills</h3>
	<div class="container">
	We know the languages of the web like the backs of our
	collective hands.  We can produce anything that you can
	imagine, from simple, straightforward HTML sites to interactive
	and animated dynamic HTML sites to database driven, catalog-type
	sites.
	<br />
	<br />
	We know the quirks of all of the major web browsers, so we
	are capable of producing high quality web sites that will appear
	the same in all of them, despite their numerous and glaring
	differences.
	<br />
	<br />
		
	Programming languages we speak like natives:
	<div class="block">
		<strong>HTML</strong> (Hypertext Markup Language), <strong>XHTML</strong> (the next generation of HTML),
		<strong>CSS</strong> (Cascading Style Sheets), <strong>Javascript/ECMAscript</strong>,
		<strong>PHP</strong>, <strong>Perl</strong>, <strong>SQL</strong> (for MySQL),
		<strong>XML</strong>, <strong>XSL/XSLT</strong>, and <strong>*nix Shell Scripting</strong>.
	</div>
	
	Software that is like butter in our capable hands:
	<div class="block">
		<strong>Photoshop</strong>, <strong>Illustrator</strong>,
		<strong>Homesite</strong>, and <strong>Flash</strong>.
	</div>
	
	
	We write all of our own code by hand, instead of using a "WYSIWYG" HTML editor.
	It gives us much more control over the final product and freedom to do exactly what we want.

	<h3>IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;Current Projects</h3>
	<div class="container">
	<strong>The Greater Longview United Way</strong> / <a href="http://www.humortree.com/PROJECTS/gluw/">gluw.org</a> (in progress)
	<div class="block">
		Project Goals
		<ol>
			<li>
				Redesign the existing web site, which falls apart in most web browsers,
				and hasn't been updated since 1999.
			</li>
			<li>Make the new site relatively simple and straightforward, but elegant.</li>
			<li>Make the new site work in <em>all</em> web browsers (which the current site fails to do).</li>
			<li>Provide an extremely easy way for staff members to update the site with news and events.</li>
		</ol>
		The site is one of the first to use our own HTpost technology, a PHP-based application that allows someone
		to log into the web site and update its content by simply filling out a form.

	<br /><br />
	
	<strong>LifeCare Home Nursing, Inc.</strong> / <a href="http://www.lifecarehn.com">LifeCareHN.com</a>
	<div class="block">
		Project Goals
		<ol>
			<li>
				Create a brand-new web site for LifeCare Home Nursing, a hospice care
				company.
			</li>
			<li>
				Make the site appeal to a specific audience: those who need hospice care for
				themselves or a loved one.
			</li>
			<li>Make the new site work in <em>all</em> web browsers.</li>
		</ol>
		LifeCareHN.com is being produced as a joint effort between the HTDC and Seth Nobles of TechMark.

	You should be commended if you've read this far.  There was a lot
	of information to digest before you got to this point, and we
	appreciate your taking the time to read it (if you did read it,
	that is).
	<br />
	<br />
	This web site was written in a piece of software called
	Allaire Homesite. The Typeface used for the logo is
	Helvetica Bold.  The photograph is of Will McCutchen's
	eyes and nose, pretty much.
	<br />
	<br />
	This web site was written using completely valid Strict XHTML
	(<a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=https://design.humortree.org/v7/">check it</a>)
	and CSS 2 
	(<a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https://design.humortree.org/v7/htdc.css">check it</a>).
	If you're using an outdated browser
	(anything that is not version 5 or 6), this web site is
	probably exceedingly ugly (but readable nontheless).
